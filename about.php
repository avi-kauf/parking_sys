    Our <i>PHP</i> project    
</h1>
<h2>What is this project about?</h2>
<p> 
    In this project we built a system where a user can reserve a single 
    parking spot in a parking lot for a whole day. To create this we used a 
    mixture of tools we learned in this semester like MySQL, PHP and others
    that we had learn before such as HTML5,CSS and Java Script.</p>

<p>
    The idea is pretty simple, you create a user in the login page and you are 
free to start reserving once for every day. While if you want to become
an administrator,a special permission will have to be added to your account
through the database itself (phpMyAdmin). Once you have that permission, you'll
have a special interface that will enable you to administrate users and their
reservations.
